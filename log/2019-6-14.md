##Optimization So Far

### Gyrate rendering

Rotation gyrate rendering is a slightly more efficient than pre-allocated gyrate rendering. In bunny scene at 128*128 resolution and 50 samples, rotation gyrate rendering took around 79s while pre-allocated gyrate rendering took 84s.
Rotation gyrate rendering is able to take advantages of strong threads and make them finish more rendering tasks.

### Non-recursive shade function
I converted the recursive shade function into a non-recursive version and found there is no obvious performance improvement.

### Debug vs Release build mode
Release build version of HJRT has massive performance improvement over debug build version.
In transparent bunny scene, release version HJRT only took 24s to complete rendering while debug version took 80+s.
