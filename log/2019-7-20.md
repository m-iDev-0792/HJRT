#### debug log 2019-7-20

In the past few days, I fixed some bugs and refactored some legacy codes.
And I found a huge bug during doing these work.

In previous diamond rendering result, showed as below, everything looks fine at the first glance.

![](img/diamond-1000samples.png)

![](img/wrongDiamond.png)

There are some refractions inside the diamond, and reflection is good.
But they are NOT real!!!!!!

Correct result:

![](img/rightDiamond.png)

(NOTE. I changed the color of right wall and left wall, but that's okay, never mind)

The correct one has more refractions! It looks like a real diamond not a glass one.

So what caused this huge bug? It was caused by the triangle intersection judegement code.

Previous code:
```cpp
hitInfo->normal = this->normal * sgn(glm::dot(-t * ray.dir, this->normal);
```
Due to my kindness, I made normal alway be in the same side of incoming ray, this caused wrong refraction result.

Fix:
```cpp
hitInfo->normal = isDoubleSided ? this->normal * sgn(glm::dot(-t * ray.dir, this->normal))
	                               : this->normal;
```
